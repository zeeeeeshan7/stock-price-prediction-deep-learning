# 📘 **Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning & Baseline Models**

This project explores the effectiveness of deep learning models—specifically LSTM architectures—compared to traditional baselines for **next-day stock price prediction** using daily OHLCV data from AAPL, AMZN, and QCOM (2010–2025).

It evaluates whether increased model complexity leads to better predictive performance in a domain known for **high noise and low signal**, and whether multi-stock pooled models or stock-ID-aware models provide practical improvements.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

The project investigates:

* Baseline models

  * Naïve persistence
  * Linear regression
* Deep learning models

  * LSTM (multi-stock pooled)
  * LSTM with stock-ID embeddings
* Optional ensemble comparison

  * HistGradientBoosting

All models are evaluated on:

* RMSE
* MAE
* MAPE
* Directional Accuracy (predicting up/down trends)

---

## 🧠 **Key Findings**

* **Linear regression outperformed all LSTM models** in predicting price direction (≈52% DA).
* LSTM variants plateaued early (2–3 epochs), showing minimal ability to capture deeper structures.
* Naïve persistence achieved the lowest RMSE due to autocorrelation, but failed to predict direction.
* Deep learning did **not** provide a performance advantage when using only daily OHLCV data.
* Findings support financial literature:

  > “More model complexity doesn’t help when data has weak predictive signal.”

## 📌 **Conclusion**

Traditional models performed as well as, or better than, deep learning for daily stock forecasting due to the weak predictive signal in OHLCV data.
Future improvements require:

* richer features (sentiment, intraday data, macro indicators)
* alternative architectures (TCN, Transformer)
* multi-task learning
* risk-aware evaluation
